A sales performance dashboard is a crucial tool for businesses to monitor and analyze their sales activities. It provides a comprehensive overview of various sales metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time or near real-time.
Additionally, these dashboards often highlight product performance data. This information helps businesses identify which products or services are selling well and which ones may need marketing adjustments or reconsideration. By understanding product performance, companies can allocate resources more effectively and focus on promoting their most profitable offerings.

KPIs are quantifiable measurements used to evaluate the success of an organization, employee, or process in meeting objectives for performance. In sales, KPIs are critical metrics that help businesses track progress towards sales goals. 

These KPIs provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, allowing managers to:

-Identify trends and patterns in sales activities
-Spot potential issues before they become significant problems
-Recognize high-performing individuals or teams
-Make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and strategy
